A full stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) project that uses Redux, MaterialUI and more. The idea behind this project is a site where you can share a memory or moment together. So for example, someone who just had a wedding can make an event page and give that link to their friends and families who can upload their own pictures from the event with a caption and title thus the name "Together Moments."

Still a work in progress.
